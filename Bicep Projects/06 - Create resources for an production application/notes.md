- When we are creating resources for production applications we need to plan and think of additional things apart from simply creating a resource and make it working.

1. Alert rules
2. Permissions on the resources
3. logs and log forwarding
4. managed identities for access of azure services insted of authentication tokens.
5. Security of those resources like firewall, defender, AV, IDS/IPS
6. Storing logs for audit purposes
7. tagging for better organization and searching
8. compliance and company standard policies enforcement.
